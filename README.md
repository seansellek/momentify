# Momentify

Momentify retrieves Momentum's daily wallpaper and quote, then sets your wallpaper and logs to stdout json for the quote.

It is used by my [Ubersicht widget](https://github.com/seansellek/momentum-ubersicht) to mimic Momentum on my desktop.

**Warning** Currently, it is hard-coded to work on my system. I plan on preparing it to release on npm, where you will be able to configure it for your own system. Mac-only support at first most likely.
